I am a computer science student and currently doing a federal apprenticeship as a systems engineer. In my down-time I am active in three main fields. Quantum mechanics, neurotechnology and DeFi (decentralized finance). I will give you an in-depth overview of my relation to these research-fields in the section &ldquo;Interests&rdquo;. Additionally I like to think about the future. I am particularly interested in interstellar habitats and the colonization of inter-planetary objects. If I&rsquo;d choose my biggest role model, it would definitely be Elon Musk. I would choose him due to his extravagant, unconventional and innovative ideas.</p><h2 id=about-this-site>About this site</h2><p>This site (42.3 kB) is built using EleventyJS and Liquid. It reflects my mininalistic KISS mindset. More simple is more powerful. I have designed this site so that, I can deploy site-updates from everywhere. I could to achieve this by adding a CI/CD Pipeline that pushes the pre-built site to surge.sh each time I do a git push to the git repository.</p><blockquote><p>Note: In the blog be dragons. Beware of them!</p></blockquote><h2 id=what-i-do>What I do</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, I like to inform myself about a variety to topics related, but not limited to technology. I will list the to me, most important fields.</p><ul><li>IT-Systems Engineering</li><li>Design, Marketing and Corporate Identity</li><li>Quantum Mechanics</li><li>Neurotechnology</li><li>Decentralized Finance and Blockchain Research</li></ul><h1 id=it-systems-and-systems-engineering>IT Systems and Systems engineering</h1><p>In 2019 I have started a 4-years apprenticeship as an IT-Systems Engineer EFZ at CPH Holding AG. Parallely I am studying computer-science at the BBZW Sursee which is a vocational center for aspiring IT Engineers. I will finish my apprenticeship in August of 2024. At CPH Holding AG, I am working in the first and second-level IT-Support, where I get acquainted with topics such as: Microsoft 365, Azure Cloud, MS Exchange, Veeam Backup, Active Directory and much much more.</p><p>In January of 2022 our company got attacked by a russian ransomware called Lockbit 2.0. This time was a very stressful time, however I have learned a ton of useful stuff such as: Incident Response and Disaster Recovery. Some days later we achieved to fully boot our network into a fully functional state by reloading our servers from a veeam container.</p><h1 id=design-marketing-and-corporate-identity>Design, Marketing and Corporate Identity</h1><p>I am an absolute design perfectionist. When I build new projects, I tend to do the marketing and design part firstly so I have a matching visual identity for the project. However, design and marketing take up a huuuuge time. I always seek to find the perfect design aspects for a certain project. And oh&mldr; did I tell you already, that I am a huge fan of minimalism, abstractionism and brutalism?</p><h1 id=quantum-mechanics>Quantum mechanics</h1><p>Roughly 1.5 years ago I have stumbled upon an amazing talk from Yann Allain, hosted by 36C3. That was the first time I came in touch with quantum mechanics. It immediately fascinated me and I started reading and studying about quantum mechanics and quantum architectures. I have learned a lot about the fundamental logic of the three main quantum technologies (photonics, superconducting and ion-trapping QC).</p><p>Quantum mechanics is a highly sophisticated topic. However, I did not deter by the fact that it was too complex. I read a lot about ion trapping quantum-computers and could to aqcuire the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Early 2022 I got in contact with Yann Allain himself. We had a conversation about the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. Since then, it is my dream to build a conceptualized quantum computer prototype based on the research of yann allain.</p><p>I wrote a research paper at academia.edu, in which I have explained a concept for a quadrupole calcium ion-trapping quantum computer. It includes the design of a laser-optics system for doppler-cooling, an ultra-high vacuum chamber (UHV) and the design of a quadrupole ion trap capturing polarized calcium ions.</p><h1 id=neurotechnology>Neurotechnology</h1><p>This is a field that I got into pretty recently. I think it is very important to gain a better overview on neuroscientific topics. Currently the human brain is probably the most unknown biological part of the human. My aim is to interdisciplinary educate myself in various topics such as: deep-learning, unsupervised-learning, stable diffusion, natural-language processing and understanding, brain simulation, genetic programming and evolution theory.</p><h1 id=defi-decentralized-finance>DeFi (decentralized finance)</h1><p>This is probably THE field that is my favorite. I love the concept of decentralized communications and transactions without relying on a centralized entity. I have been in this space since 2019. It all started by stumbling upon the financial capabilities of UTXO (Bitcoin) and the CryptoNote protocol (Monero). I started to read manuals about the core-internals and eventually contributed to their codebases.</p><p>Later, I met a lot of smart people in this space who gave me a more detailed knowledge. I got into the cross-chain protocols Cosmos and Polkadot/Substrate. Through this finding, I have learnt that blockchains are able to inter-communicate with other L1 chains. In 2020 I came across the Ethereum network. And this moment was like:</p><h2 id=the-aha-moment>The AHA Moment</h2><p>The Ethereum network was a whole new universe to me. From there, I found out that one would be able to procedurally program the blockchain by defining smart-contracts.</p><blockquote><p>Note: I explain the technical aspects of smart-contracts in my blog.</p></blockquote><p>By allowing developers to build financially decentralized applications on top of Ethereum, it created a whole new space called DeFi. In defi I learned a lot about Uniswap, Aave Lending, NFTs, Yield Optimization and Yield Farms, IDO/IFO/ICO and with the most important Ethereum change request proposals such as ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155.
From there on I am constantly expanding my knowledge landscape by learning about scalability solutions, TradeFi (futures, options, derivatives, synthetic assets) and a lot more.</p><h2 id=current-work>Current work</h2><p>Currently I am working on three projects in this space:</p><ul><li>Lumina protocol: Cross-chain asynchronous L1 chain with zero network fees, UBI for node-validators and a ton of good DeFi apps (orderbooks and AMMs)</li><li>Decentrum: Decentralized trading platform for single-asset limit-order trades on the BSC (binance smart-chain)</li><li>Pessimism L2: Layer-2 blockchain enabling Pessimistic Rollups on EVM compatible chains.</li></ul><h1 id=non-nerdy-interests>Non-nerdy Interests</h1><p>Yeah. I know what you probably think.: I must have a pretty tight time-plan. Yeah that is absolutely true, but I live my life by living each day in harmony with my inner-desire. I do also things each other human does so, this makes me not a pure science-nerd :=). In my free-time I like to hit the gym, listen to some deep and kpop. My fav-bands are: BTS, Ateez, GHOST9, NCT and Blackpink. My favourite dish is japanese sushi. I love the minimalist design aspects of food like sushi. It can be so influencing on consumer :). I also like spending my time in the Zug / Lucernce area.</p></div><ul class=article-taxonomy></article></main><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return;}
